# SurvivalHelper
Simple commands to enhance gameplay. Includes commands to find mob spawning locations, slime chunks, spectator mode, and the locations of nearby spawners.

## Commands
This plugin currently features five commands! Here are the details:

### /slimef
This command will show the player nearby slime chunks in the server's render distance. This will be shown via a minature map located in the chat. 
Permission: SurvivalHelper.find.slime

### /spawnerf
Similar to */slimef*, this will show the player nearby loaded spawners. This has a range of the server's render distance.
Permission: SurvivalHelper.find.spawner

### /spectate
This command will change the player into a spectator mode. This will allow them to survey the surrounding area. When they are done, they can use the command again to teleport them back to their original position in their original gamemode.
Permission: SurvivalHelper.cycle

### /spawnablef
This is a heavy-duty command that should not be given lightly. When used, it will show the player nearby spawnable locations. It is currently fairly primitive, but it will hopefully be upgraded in the future.
Permission: SurvivalHelper.find.spawnableblocks
